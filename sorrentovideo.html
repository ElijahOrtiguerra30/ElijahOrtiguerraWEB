                <h4>Bathing Boxes</h4>

                <p>
                    Dive into Port Phillip Bay under the watch of 82 distinctive bathing boxes, a row of uniformly proportioned wooden structures lining the foreshore at Brighton Beach.
                    <br><br>
                    Built well over a century ago in response to very Victorian ideas of morality and seaside bathing, the bathing boxes remain almost unchanged. All retain classic Victorian architectural features with timber framing, weatherboards and corrugated iron roofs, though they also bear the hallmarks of individual licencees' artistic and colourful embellishments.

                <h4>Bass Strait Side</h4>

                <p>
                    If you're an experienced surfer looking for big swells from Bass Strait, Surf Beach is your answer!
                    <br><br>
                    Surf Beach and its surrounding beaches are popular with experienced surfers, and are ideal for pro surfers looking to catch some waves - and the views aren't bad either! It does, however, have strong rips and currents, and isn't suitable for swimming. Low tide exposes rock pools, and the beach is a great place for beach games and relaxing.

                <h4>Coastal Walk</h4>
                <img src="images/CoastalWalk.jpg" height="250px" width="500px">
                <p>
                    The Coastal walk along the southern side of the SHire of Mornington Peninsula offers spectacular scenery stretching 30kms between Cape Schanck and the Point Nepean National Park. The Coastal Walk encompasses many smaller sections of Ocean Beach walking trails, some along gravel tracks and parts along the sandy beaches. It changes from rugged rocky ocean coast at Cape Schanck to dense coastal vegetation along the way and finally to the famous sandy surf beaches through Rye and Sorrento. There are several sections that can be completed seperately as shorter walks if desired.
                    <br><br>
                    Although this walk can be done in either direction, more spectacular views are provided when walking west from Cape Schanck to Point Nepean as you get views along the length of the Bass Strait coast. Cape Schanck to Gunnamatta Beach (6.7km): Find your way through dense coastal vegetation and past three spectacular lookouts.
